# Token Smart Contract

## Overview
Token is a smart contract implemented in Solidity. This smart contract allows for the creation and destruction of tokens through minting and burning functions. It includes public variables for token details, a mapping for tracking balances, and functions to manage the token supply.

## Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract provides functionality to mint and burn tokens, thereby managing the total supply. It serves as a straightforward introduction to token creation and supply management in Solidity, and can be used as a foundation for more complex token-based projects in the future.

## Getting Started

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

## Executing Program

1. **Create a New File**: 
   - Click on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar.
   - Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol).
   - Copy and paste the code from this repo into the file:

2. **Compile the Code**:
   - Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
   - Ensure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version).
   - Click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.

3. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - Click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
   - Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu.
   - Click on the "Deploy" button.

4. **Interact with the Contract**:
   - Once deployed, interact with the contract by calling the mint and burn functions.
   - For example, to mint tokens, input the address and value, and click on the mint function. Similarly, to burn tokens, input the address and value, and click on the burn function.
